# Report-vulnerability
Github action for reporting a vulnerability.
Use it with a scheduled Github actions workflow.

## Prerequisites

Inputs:

* `report-file` - Name of the file with a reported created by Snyk.

Environment variables:

* `TOKEN` - Environment variable containing the value of `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret.

## Example usage

The following workflow runs a scheduled check every Monday at 02:00.
First it runs a check using Snyk with your token generated at Snyk web-site.
If Snyk finds an issue, it throws an error in `stderr` and creates a report file.
If Snyk step fails (there is an issues found) then the last step runs and reports it if that issue was not already reported.
